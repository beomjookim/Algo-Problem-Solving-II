# Baekjoon-Problem-Solving(LLFE PS study)
# 백준 문제 풀이(멋사 코테 스터디)

Below is the list of the problems that we(LLFE advanced PS study) dealt with/ will be dealing with for 3 months.  
We chose 1 topic for a week, studied the theory, tried 5 problems related and debated to derive the best solution.  
All problems are from [baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/).  

세달여 간 LLFE PS 스터디에서 다룬/다룰 문제 리스트입니다. 한 주에 한 토픽을 정하여 이론 공부하고, 5문제를 선정해 각자 풀고 최적의 풀이를 토론을 통해 도출하였습니다. 모든 문제는 [백준](https://www.acmicpc.net/)에서 가져왔습니다.
