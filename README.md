# Algorithm-Problem-Solving (LLFE PS study)
# 알고리즘 문제 풀이 (멋사 코테 스터디)

Below is the list of the problems that we(LLFE advanced PS study) dealt with/ will be dealing with.  
We chose 1 topic for a week, studied the theory, tried 4~5 problems related and debated to derive the best solution.  
All problems are from [baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/), [programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).  

LLFE PS 스터디에서 다룬/다룰 문제 리스트입니다. 한 주에 한 토픽을 정하여 이론 공부하고, 4~5문제를 선정해 각자 풀고 최적의 풀이를 토론을 통해 도출하였습니다. 모든 문제는 [백준](https://www.acmicpc.net/), [프로그래머스](https://programmers.co.kr/) 혹은 [리트코드](https://leetcode.com/)에서 가져왔습니다.
